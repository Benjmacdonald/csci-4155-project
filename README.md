## Contributions

### Pull Requests

All contributions to `main` must be happen through a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

When a branch is made, ensure it uses one of the prefixes listed below:

- `feature/<short description of feature>` for all modifications to the codebase.
- `bugfix/<short description of bug>` for all patches.
- `hotfix/<short description of fix>` for any fix that needs to be applied to `main` quickly
- `doc/<short description of what is being written>` for any modifications or additions to the documentation.

### Commits

The practices outlined in [this article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) should be followed when making commits.

In general, only the subject line is required. The subject line must start with one of the following verbs:
- `doc[ument] <describe what was documented>` 
- `refactor <what was refactored>`
- `impl[ement] <what feature was added>`
- `build <what change to the build process was made>`
